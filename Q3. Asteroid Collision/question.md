Stack-based simulation

Issue Description:
Asteroids move in a straight line. Positive values move right, negative move left.
When two asteroids collide, the smaller one explodes.

This problem tests stack-based simulation and collision handling.

Acceptance Criteria:

Correct final asteroid state

Handles multiple cascading collisions

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(n)
