Concept to Read:

Stack-based greedy reduction

Prefix maximum logic

Issue Description:
Given an array, perform operations to reduce it following specific constraints and determine the minimal operations required.

This problem mixes greedy reasoning with stack-like behavior.

Acceptance Criteria:

Correct minimal operation count

Efficient traversal

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(n)
