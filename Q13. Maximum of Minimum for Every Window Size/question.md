Concept to Read:

Previous & Next Smaller Element

Stack-based range contribution

Issue Description:
For every window size from 1 to n, find the maximum of minimum elements of all subarrays of that size.

This is a high-signal hard problem using stacks.

Acceptance Criteria:

Correct result for all window sizes

Efficient use of stack for bounds

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(n)
