Concept to Read:

Previous Smaller Element

Next Smaller Element

Stack-based range contribution

Issue Description:
For every window size from 1 to n, find the maximum of minimum values among all subarrays of that size.

This problem is a classic hard monotonic stack question.

Acceptance Criteria:

Correct output for all window sizes

Efficient stack usage for bounds

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(n)
